# AniWiki
Simply an anime & manga wiki built with react and powered by AniList API.

## Tech I used:
- Vite / React
- TailwindCSS
- Typescript
- React Router
- Apollo Client
- AniList GraphQL API (not a tech but why not)

## Why?
Demonstating I can work with graphql apis (even if they can be a little annoying at first)

## Problems I faced:
- ### Routing:
  At first was confusing but then I resorted to React Router (I don't want to refetch with every rerender and hyperlinks are bad for navigation)
- ### Design and Layout:
  I didn't have a layout in mind first and I was thinking that the entire project looks like a Spaghetti but then I went into dribbble and youtube to take inspiration
- ### Colors:
  I love the black and white aesthetic but with this project there are a lot of images which don't fit right with the theme of simplicity so I resorted to a dimmed changing wallpaper
- ### Stuff:
  If anything else I had no problems with the code since I'm used to front-end shenanigans
