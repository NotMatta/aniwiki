**AniWiki** is a sleek and responsive anime & manga wiki built with React and powered by the AniList GraphQL API.

**Tech Stack:**

* **Frontend:** Vite, React, TailwindCSS, Typescript, React Router
* **Backend:** Apollo Client 
* **Data Source:** AniList GraphQL API

**The Challenge:**

This project served as an opportunity to demonstrate my ability to work with GraphQL APIs, even if they have their initial learning curve.

**Overcoming Obstacles:**

* **Routing:** React Router became the hero, preventing unnecessary re-renders and promoting seamless navigation. Hyperlinks were out!
* **Design & Layout:** Dribbble and Youtube provided inspiration to turn initial spaghetti code into a visually appealing layout.
* **Color Scheme:** While drawn to a black & white aesthetic, the abundance of images demanded a compromise. A dynamic, dimmed wallpaper brought balance.

**Conquering Quirks:**

* **Deployment:** HashRouter replaced BrowserRouter to appease Github Pages, along with a base URL adjustment in the Vite config.
* **Browser Compatibility:** Chrome's occasional CSS hiccups (remember, I'm a Firefox user!) were patiently addressed.
